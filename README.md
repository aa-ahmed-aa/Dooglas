# 🐶 Dooglas
A python script that will count courses full time for you 🎰🐱‍👤

## 🦄 Install and usage
- Install python3 (i created this project while using Python 3.7.3 )
- Install the required packages from the requirements.txt file.
    '''
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    '''
- Run the script
    '''
        python dooglas.py
    '''
    
## 🐸 How it works
     it will treat the current working directory as 
     the root and all the folders as your courses  
     and all the subfolders are related to this course.
